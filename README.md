You will probably want to fork this repo to your own Github account. To do this, just click the "fork" button near the top right corner of the page.

To ''clone'' the repo to your local machine, copy the url inside the text field near the top of the page (make sure that "HTTP" is selected).  Run this command from your terminal:

	git clone URL_THAT_YOU_JUST_COPIED

When that is done running you should see a new folder called "learn-python" in your current directory.
